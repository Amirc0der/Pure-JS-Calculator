# Simple Pure JS Calculator
#### This has been my first JS work.<br> I wrote it without any kind of tutorial. <br>There are better ways out there to write a calculator for sure, but this is my way. :)<br> I am actually using it myself, because it can get multiple mathematical commands together and calculate them in the correct order. Other calculators out there are not like this.
