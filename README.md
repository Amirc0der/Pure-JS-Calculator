# Simple Pure JS Calculator
#### this has been my first JS training.<br> I wrote it without any kind of tutorial. <br> Absolutely there are better ways out there to write a calculator, but this is my way. :)<br> This is my own creativity. <br> I am actually using it myself, because it can accept multiple mathematical commands together and calculate it in the correct order. <br> Other calculators out there are not like this.
